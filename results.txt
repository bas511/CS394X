One of the most prominent results the scores showed is that the controllers with the highest score used a larger personal space variable.  They also resulted in the longest game in terms of time played.  The data shows that the controller that got the highest score was the "Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind" approach which used a bigger personal space varible.  Its goal was to collect pills until there was a threat, at which point it would run away. In the process of running away from the ghosts, it managed to cover a lot of ground, stay alive the longest, and actually take care of collecting the pills and using the power pills to the most possible.  It also had the second longest game, second only to the Run And Hide Big Personal Space.  By running away, the time survived was maximized.

The most reliable of the algorithms also followed the Run And Hide approach.  It had the highest average score and the highest average time per game, as well as the largest low score.  Interestingly enough, the Angry Greedy algorithm with a Small Personal Space was the second most reliable.  Greedy Algorithms are usually very short sighted so adding the Small Personal Space is effective because it allows the majority of the pills to be collected as fast as possible, until there is a danger.  Interestingly enough, a short sighted algorithm that chases the ghosts when powered, Angry Greedy, worked really well and was third most reliable.  This AI worked effectively because we took something that was effective in the short run, and made it smarter in the long run by forcing it to keep a larger distance between the ghosts.  Short sighted aggression and the ability to see far away allowed this controller to thrive.

The normal Out Of Sight Out Of Mind approach failed pretty much across the board, as it had the lowest results of them all in terms of lowest score and average game.  Angry Out Of Sight Out Of Mind did second worst in both of these categories.  Evidently, Out Of Sight Out Of Mind alone isn't enough to be successful, there must be the check to keep the ghosts as far away as possible.  

Another interesting note is that the data shows that it is much safer to stay away from the ghosts, even when powered up. This is evident by noticing because none of the "Angry" controllers performed at a high level relative to other, less agressive controllers.  This could possibly be due to getting closer to the enemy than comfortable and then running out of power, thus falling into traps.

These results show that overall the controllers that worked the best are the ones that always try to keep a large distance between Ms. Pac-Man and the ghosts, regardless of whether Ms. Pac-Man is powered up or not, and that of the three different conditions we created, the personal space is the most important one to factor in.
